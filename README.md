- 👋 Hi, I’m Ephraim Kanyemba
- 👀 I’m interested in learning languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript is essential. Each has different applications, from web development to data science and automation
- Web Development: Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) development skills are valuable and offer hands-on projects like building websites, portfolios, or even a personal blog.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ as it's known to be the fast and efficient making it ideal for applications where performance is critical, like game engines, operating systems, and real-time simulations.
- Its close-to-hardware nature gives you control over memory management, which is essential for resource-intensive tasks and I'm looking forward to expand my knowlege in C++

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development,  simple website or web application project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Examples include a personal portfolio site, a blog, or a simple to-do list app.
-  as well as mini games in C++ and Javascript which could be an excitin practice for me to expand my c++ skills. To collaborate with others by dividing responsibilities for different game features, such as UI, scoring, and gameplay logic.

- ⚡ Fun fact: "404 Error" Has a Backstory: The "404 Error" page we see when a website can’t be found supposedly comes from Room 404 at CERN,
-  where the team managing the World Wide Web first handled issues related to web access. However, this story is more of an urban legend than fact.
